352	10	41	\N	KUMON Math Test	Today I am taking the test. If you did all of your homework then you can take the test. If you pass the test you can go to a higher level. It was all the things I reviewed at the KUMON center. When I finished it I out the time and gave it to Ms. Kim. We sat at the help table. I only got 1 thing wrong. It was a multiplication question. I got 79 out of 80. Which means I got only 1 wrong! Next level is D. Ms. Kim says it's a 4th grade work. Long division and long multiplication. Even fractions. But at the end of fractions it looked pretty hard. 	\N	Kumon	#F44E3B	""	2017-05-01 00:00:00	2017-05-01 00:00:00	2017-05-02 04:22:51.809951	2017-05-02 14:53:48.018972
353	10	40	\N	Finishing the test	So last time I did 25 questions. Ms. Gelber said I had to do only 30 because I did 25 questions. But I didn't listen to her because I didn't know what she meant. Since I didn't know what she meant so instead, I did all of the 36 questions. Some of them were hard so that means I answered most of the questions right. When I was done with the whole entire math test I started to read.	\N	DixieCanyion	#AB149E	null	2017-05-02 00:00:00	2017-05-02 00:00:00	2017-05-02 22:08:48.455832	\N

We first got water then a burrito then we got Recese's pieces and it was shaped like Skittles or M&Ms. I was excited to meet Dan because he was my favorite you tuber. The show was about Dr. Trayurous making a spell. But then instead of a spell Evil Dan came out of the cannon or whatever. So Dan has to beat Evil Dan's plans. At the final stage they were fighting each other. Then Dan almost died but then he used our help to beat Evil Dan and Dan won! I enjoyed the show. It was fun. I also got a stuffed animal. It looked like one of Dan's pugs. It's Darcie or Ellie. But I think it's Darcie because Darcie is small while Ellie is bigger. Jaelen got a hat. In total it cost $60. It was a lot.

379	10	8	\N	2nd day in Las Vegas	In the morning we ate breakfast with our aunt. We ate at another hotel. The line was short because we came there pretty early. My family and I went to the bathroom to wash our hands. My dad was in the bathroom for a pretty long time. I was thinking if he was going poo or just waiting in a very long line. But that was impossible because my brother went to the bathroom with my dad. My mom wanted an 8 people table with 2 families. The person who works there said you can't because you can't sit with 8 people. Only 5 people. So we sat separately. When we were seated, my dad finally came out of the bathroom. My mom asked him why he was in the bathroom for a long time. He said that he went poo. So I was correct. Then this girl came and asked us what drinks we would like to drink. I said water. My mom said coffee. Then we got some food at the buffet. I got mini pancakes with strawberry sauce. Then I got more food. I visited my aunts where they sat to eat. There was a whole other section with food. There was all kinds of cheese and salamis. I was also getting full. The fullest I ever was. When we were done eating, my family, aunts, and I talked to each other. I talked with Morgan, Madison, and my brother, Jaelen. We did a spelling game and a math game. Madison Was the judge. We did 6th grade spelling words. It was hard. Madison also did very hard multiplication. Then we talked about another way to say female dog. It's the same as the Bit-- word. And I already knew that. Then Morgan's dad and my dad came to the table and gave us sprite and orange mixed with lemon drink. I didn't want any of those so I my mom just passed me a water-bottle and poured it in the cup that has ice in it. I picked up the ice and I ate it. My teeth was freezing! Then we talked about weird stuff. When we were done eating we went to our hotel. We changed into our swim suits. When we were done we went to the elevator. Then we went to the pool place. Morgan. Madison, and their parents were there already. Then e started swimming. I swam at the wave pool. It was so much fun. i love it when a wave comes at you because it has a good feeling when you go up the water. I don't know why. Then we went to Lazy River. It's so cool how the water moves by itself. I love the waterfall part. Water comes from the high place and falls on your head. Madison couldn't do it because she has an infection on her ear. Then Morgan, Madison and I went pack to Wave pool. My dad was still in Lazy River. Madison went to the jacuzzi. Then Morgan and I went to the swimming pool.	\N	Las Vegas, NV	#653294	["https://process.filepicker.io/ACGRkMPr9TqmbgPiHBS5Cz/resize=width:500,height:500,fit:crop/rotate=deg:exif/https://process.filepicker.io/ACGRkMPr9TqmbgPiHBS5Cz/resize=width:500,height:500,fit:crop/rotate=deg:exif/https://process.filepicker.io/ACGRkMPr9TqmbgPiHBS5Cz/resize=width:500,height:500,fit:crop/rotate=deg:exif/https://ucarecdn.com/7b057ce7-3b34-4233-a37a-ff7ac0409052~2/nth/0/", "https://process.filepicker.io/ACGRkMPr9TqmbgPiHBS5Cz/resize=width:500,height:500,fit:crop/rotate=deg:exif/https://process.filepicker.io/ACGRkMPr9TqmbgPiHBS5Cz/resize=width:500,height:500,fit:crop/rotate=deg:exif/https://process.filepicker.io/ACGRkMPr9TqmbgPiHBS5Cz/resize=width:500,height:500,fit:crop/rotate=deg:exif/https://ucarecdn.com/7b057ce7-3b34-4233-a37a-ff7ac0409052~2/nth/1/"]	2017-06-11 00:00:00	2017-06-11 00:00:00	2017-06-14 04:54:05.334121	2017-06-14 20:43:52.261011

Gelber as a teacher because she is funny. Even though she is strict I still like her as a 3rd grade teacher. One thing I didn't like about school is that, you have to do reports. I don't like reports. I don't like to present my project in front of everyone! I just hate it. That's how my mind was built. I was going to miss my school. And my friends. But Eliana can text me..
